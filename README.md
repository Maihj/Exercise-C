###Introduction###
These are some of the exercises in the book The C Programming Language, 2nd, written by Brian W.Kernighan and Dennis M.Ritchie.

While learning this book, I try to finish the exercises as much as I can do, and now I push them into GitHub. In the meantime, I hope I can improve my ability of coding, which is my initial goal.
